OpenMP
==================================

OpenMP is a parallel programming framework based on shared memory computer architectures. It aims to simplify the process of writing and debugging parallel programs, and makes it possible to achieve parallelization on multicore or multiprocessor systems. OpenMP supports parallelization in languages such as C, C++, and Fortran, and provides a set of preprocessor directives and library functions for implementing parallel computations.

In OpenMP, programmers can use directive comments to mark the parts of their code that should be parallelized, and use OpenMP library functions to control the way parallel execution is performed. This approach makes parallelization implementation relatively easy and can be reused on different hardware platforms.
