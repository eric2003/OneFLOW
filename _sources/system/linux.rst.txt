`touch command in Linux with Examples <https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/touch-command-in-linux-with-examples/>`_

The touch command is a standard command used in the UNIX/Linux operating system which is used to create, change and modify the timestamps of a file. Basically, there are two different commands to create a file in the Linux system which are as follows:

cat command: 
`````````````````
It is used to create the file with content.

touch command: 
`````````````````
It is used to create a file without any content. The file created using the touch command is empty. This command can be used when the user doesnâ€™t have data to store at the time of file creation.
