CFD
==================================

CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) is a method of simulating physical phenomena such as fluid motion, heat and mass transfer using computer algorithms. CFD can be used to predict and optimize fluid dynamic phenomena such as gas and liquid flows, combustion processes, heat transfer, and aerodynamics. It is widely used in various engineering fields, such as aviation, automotive, energy, construction, environmental, biomedical, as well as scientific research and development. CFD technology typically requires knowledge from multiple disciplines such as numerical analysis, mathematics, physics, and computer science to study and apply.
