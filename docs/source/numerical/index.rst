Numerical analysis is a branch of mathematics that solves continuous problems using numeric approximation. It involves designing methods that give approximate but accurate numeric solutions, which is useful in cases where the exact solution is impossible or prohibitively expensive to calculate. Numerical analysis also involves characterizing the convergence, accuracy, stability, and computational complexity of these methods.
