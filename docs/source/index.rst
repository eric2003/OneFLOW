OneFLOW Scientific Computation
===============================

LargeScale Multiphysics Scientific Simulation Environment

OneFLOW is a general-purpose, unstructured Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software with a software architecture that encompasses multidisciplinary computations. It covers low-speed, transonic, and hypersonic ranges. The software employs second-order accurate finite volume method for numerical solution of Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations. It integrates calculation schemes such as Roe, Van-Leer, AUSM, Steger-Warming, and provides SA and SST turbulence models. OneFLOW uses large-scale parallel computing technology and explicit/implicit time formats to efficiently solve the model equations. The software provides commonly used front-end and back-end software interfaces such as Gridgen, Tecplot, and others. OneFLOW is cross-platform, capable of running on both Windows and Linux, enabling large-scale parallel computing on local Windows workstations and remote high-performance computing clusters.
