CGNS
==================================

CGNS (Computational Fluid Dynamics General Notation System) is a universal file format and library for storing and exchanging computational fluid dynamics (CFD) data.

The CGNS format is scalable and portable, making it suitable for various CFD applications and tools. It provides a standardized way to describe and transmit CFD grids, flow fields, and other related data, enabling data exchange and interoperability between different CFD software.

The CGNS format contains a hierarchical structure and supports multiple grid types (such as structured, unstructured, hybrid grids, etc.) and cell types (such as triangles, tetrahedrons, hexahedrons, etc.). It also supports multiple bases and zones, allowing for separate processing and storage of different flow fields.

There are also open-source tools and libraries available for CGNS format, including CGNS API (C, Fortran, and Python), HDF5 library (for storing and reading CGNS files), ParaView (for visualizing CGNS data), and more.

Overall, CGNS format and library are important and useful tools in the field of CFD, simplifying and accelerating the storage, transmission, and processing of CFD data.
