OpenCL
==================================

OpenCL came as a standard for heterogeneous programming that enables a code to run in different platforms, such as multicore CPUs, GPUs (AMD, Intel, ARM), FPGAs, Apple M1, tensor cores, and ARM processors with minor or no modifications.

Furthermore, differently from OpenACC, the programmer has full control of the hardware and is entirely responsible for the parallelization process.

However, this portability has a cost, thatâ€™s the reason why OpenCL exposes the programmer to a much lower level compared to OpenACC or even CUDA.
